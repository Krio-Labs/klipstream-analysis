# Twitch Download Scripts

This document explains the purpose of the deprecated download scripts and why they're no longer needed.

## Deprecated Scripts

The following scripts have been deprecated and are no longer actively used:

- `download_only.py.deprecated` - A simplified script that uses the `TwitchVideoDownloader` class to download a Twitch video and convert it to audio.
- `test_download.py.deprecated` - A test script that directly uses the TwitchDownloaderCLI and ffmpeg executables to download and convert a video.

## Why They're Deprecated

These scripts were created during the development and testing phase of the Twitch download functionality. They served as standalone utilities and test scripts to verify that the TwitchDownloaderCLI integration was working correctly.

Now that the TwitchDownloaderCLI integration is fully implemented and working properly in the main application through the `TwitchVideoDownloader` class in `audio_downloader.py`, these scripts are redundant and no longer needed.

## Current Implementation

The current implementation of the Twitch download functionality is in the `audio_downloader.py` file, which contains the `TwitchVideoDownloader` class. This class provides a robust and feature-rich implementation that:

1. Handles platform-specific differences (Windows, macOS, Linux)
2. Provides progress tracking during download and conversion
3. Implements proper error handling and logging
4. Cleans up temporary files after processing
5. Extracts video metadata

The main application uses this class to download Twitch videos and convert them to audio for further processing.

## Testing the Current Implementation

To test the current implementation, you can use the main application or run the `audio_downloader.py` script directly:

```bash
python audio_downloader.py
```

This will prompt you for a Twitch video URL and then download and convert the video to audio.

Alternatively, you can use the `test_cloud_function.py` script to test the entire pipeline, including the download functionality:

```bash
python test_cloud_function.py
```
