# Project Reorganization

This document explains the reorganization of the Klipstream Analysis project.

## Previous Structure

Previously, the project had multiple files handling different aspects of the raw file processing:

- `raw_pipeline.py`: Orchestration script for raw file processing
- `raw_file_processor.py`: Main processor for raw files
- `audio_downloader.py`: Video downloading and audio extraction
- `audio_transcription.py`: Audio transcription
- `audio_waveform.py`: Waveform generation
- `chat_download.py`: Chat downloading
- `gcs_upload.py`: Google Cloud Storage upload

This structure led to some duplication and made it difficult to maintain the codebase.

## New Structure

The project has been reorganized into a more modular structure:

```
klipstream-analysis/
├── raw_pipeline/         # Raw file processing modules
│   ├── __init__.py       # Package initialization
│   ├── downloader.py     # Video downloading and audio extraction
│   ├── transcriber.py    # Audio transcription
│   ├── waveform.py       # Waveform generation
│   ├── chat.py           # Chat downloading
│   ├── processor.py      # Main processor orchestration
│   └── uploader.py       # GCS upload functionality
├── analysis/             # Analysis modules
│   ├── __init__.py       # Package initialization
│   ├── audio_analysis.py # Audio analysis
│   ├── chat_analysis.py  # Chat analysis
│   ├── sentiment.py      # Sentiment analysis
│   └── visualization.py  # Visualization
├── utils/                # Utility modules
│   ├── __init__.py       # Package initialization
│   ├── config.py         # Configuration and constants
│   ├── logging_setup.py  # Centralized logging setup
│   └── helpers.py        # Common utility functions
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Modular Structure**: Each module has a clear responsibility and is organized into a logical folder structure.

2. **Centralized Configuration**: All constants and configuration settings are now in `utils/config.py`.

3. **Consistent Logging**: Logging is now handled consistently through `utils/logging_setup.py`.

4. **Common Utilities**: Common utility functions are now in `utils/helpers.py`.

5. **Simplified Imports**: The new structure makes imports cleaner and more intuitive.

6. **Reduced Duplication**: Code duplication has been reduced by consolidating related functionality.

## Usage

The main entry point (`main.py`) has been updated to use the new structure. The raw pipeline can be accessed through:

```python
from raw_pipeline import process_raw_files

# Process raw files
result = await process_raw_files(url)
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Analysis Modules**: The analysis modules should be reorganized in a similar way.

2. **Testing**: Add unit tests for each module.

3. **Documentation**: Add more detailed documentation for each module.

4. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms.

5. **Configuration**: Add support for configuration files to make the project more configurable.
